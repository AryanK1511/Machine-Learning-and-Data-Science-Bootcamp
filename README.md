# Machine Learning and Data Science Bootcamp

This repository is a collection of all the files, resources, notes, and code that I used to learn Machine Learning and Data Science. All the code and notes here have been gathered from various sources, and I have compiled them into this repository.

The main learning and roadmap came from ZTM Academy's course on Udemy called [Complete Machine Learning and Data Science Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/share/102vAM3@H5XRhtNJEcNlmDd10XB9mogV4-FFZJsoDWEZNIZC7rUdFEP3KAdlC4NqkcHDJz8a/).
